# Annotation Life Cycle Management

This repository contains code for managing annotations across all projects using AI/ML.

The code is labeled by project and should be run sequentially for all code numbered 00+. Code numbered 99 is intended to be run once or ad hoc, depending on the need.

FAQ:
* Should users be adding the names of detection files to the tracking processing step form? Yes. They should be updated the processed/validated detection file names as they're created.
